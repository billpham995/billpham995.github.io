This is my GitHub webpage, designed as a portfolio to showcase my IT skills and knowledge to recruiters. <br/>
On this site, I summarise my past projects and share more about my professional background.
The live portfolio is available at: < https://billpham995.github.io/index.html >
My source code and repository can be viewed at < https://github.com/billpham995 >, where I demonstrate my ability in HTML and CSS to develop this portfolio website.
