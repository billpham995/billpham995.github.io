			<p> I have had an amazing journey in the last 10 years in Australia. I started living in Melbourne briefly before moving to Tasmania. Compared to Melbourne, Tasmania is quieter and less crowded. But the Tassie people are friendly and helpful, similar to Melbourne people </p>
			<p> Tasmania has historical value and tradition, based on the building architecture and people's culture. Tassie are proud of their coffee bean, farmed salmon and pies; though the older generation also enjoys Fish and Chip.  </p>

			<p> During 6 years in Tasmania, I studied and worked in the customer service area. I had the opportunity to meet talented people and learned a great deal from them. </p>
